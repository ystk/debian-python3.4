Description: Debug Build of the Python Interpreter (version 3.4)
 The package holds two things:
 .
 - A Python interpreter configured with --pydebug. Dynamically loaded modules
   are searched as <foo>_d.so first. Third party extensions need a separate
   build to be used by this interpreter.
 - Debug information for standard python interpreter and extensions.
 .
 See the README.debug for more information.
